# Final Project - Group 8 Code Folder

# Guide to download the datasets and run project code

# This folder contains the following:



1. To download "Validation_images",the image data folder, 

   copy and paste the following command line in your cloud instance:  
   
   wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ml1-group8-data/Validation_images.zip [your dir]
   
   
2. Type this in your cloud to unzip the image data zip folder '$ Unzip Validations_images.zip'


3. Also, download the following 3 files from Final Project Group8 Github:

    new_labels1.csv

    Tensorflow_cnn_new.py 

    Keras_kfold.py
    
    Keras_cnn.py from Github
    
 
4. Please run these codes on Python 2 


5. Inside the script (code) of Tensorflow_cnn_new.py and Keras_cnn.py, change the directory path to the  path where 
   
   you downloaded the "Validation_images" data and "new_Labels1.csv" data in your cloud instance.
   
   For example, ‘home/amir/group8/Validation_images’


3. After changing the directory, you are ready to run both Tensorflow_cnn.py and Keras_cnn.py




```python

```
